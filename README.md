## Hi, I'm Shea 👋

![Shea](./pic.jpg)
I’m a **data analyst** driven by a passion for turning raw data into **meaningful insights** that shape **business strategy**. 

Over the past **four years**, I’ve led cross-industry projects in **user behaviour analysis**, **ad performance tracking**, and **inventory modelling**, delivering results such as a **113% increase** in followers and an **80% reduction in waste**. 

I recently completed the Generation UK & Ireland Data Analytics programme, gaining hands-on experience across the full analytics workflow—from **data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis and data visualisation** to presentation—using **Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI**. Combining technical skills with strong communication abilities, I translate complex findings into clear, actionable recommendations. As I move into a data-focused role, I’m eager to continue growing, learning, and applying an **analytical, curious, and adaptable mindset** to deliver impact through evidence-based strategies.
